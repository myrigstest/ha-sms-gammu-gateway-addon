# SMS Gammu Gateway Add-on

This repository hosts the maintained fork of the SMS Gammu Gateway add-on for Home Assistant, now living at [https://github.com/myrigstest/ha-sms-gammu-gateway-addon](https://github.com/myrigstest/ha-sms-gammu-gateway-addon).

Huge thanks to [PavelVe](https://github.com/PavelVe) for the original add-on repository that inspired this edition, and to [pajikos](https://github.com/pajikos) for the upstream SMS gateway project.
