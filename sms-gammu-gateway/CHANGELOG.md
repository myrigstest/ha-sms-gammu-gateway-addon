# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.3] - 2025-10-11

### Added
- Optional `debug` configuration flag to enable verbose logging and Gammu trace output at `/data/gammu-debug.log`

### Changed
- Automatic Unicode detection for REST, MQTT and button sends so Cyrillic text is encoded without manual flags
- MQTT payloads and API responses now keep non-ASCII characters by disabling ASCII-only JSON serialisation

## [1.3.2] - 2025-01-21

### Changed
- **Sensor Naming Improvement** - Renamed "USB Device Status" to "Modem Status" for better clarity
- Updated sensor icon from `mdi:usb` to `mdi:connection` for more appropriate representation
- Improved logging messages with better emoji indicators (üì∂ ONLINE, ‚ùå OFFLINE)
- Updated unique_id from `sms_gateway_device_status` to `sms_gateway_modem_status`

## [1.3.1] - 2025-01-21

### Added
- **USB Device Status Sensor** - New MQTT sensor monitoring GSM device connectivity
- Real-time tracking of device communication success/failure
- Detailed device status with attributes: last_seen, consecutive_failures, last_error
- Smart offline detection (10 minutes without successful communication)
- Status logging with emoji indicators (üì± ONLINE, üö´ OFFLINE, ‚ùì UNKNOWN)

### Enhanced
- **Comprehensive Gammu Operation Tracking** - All gammu communications now monitored
- REST API endpoints, periodic status checks, SMS operations tracked
- Automatic device status updates on every communication attempt
- Home Assistant auto-discovery includes new USB Device Status sensor

### Technical Details
- Added `DeviceConnectivityTracker` class for communication monitoring
- Wrapped all gammu operations with connectivity tracking
- Device status published to MQTT topic: `{topic_prefix}/device_status/state`
- Status states: "online", "offline", "unknown" with detailed attributes

## [1.3.0] - 2025-01-21

### Fixed
- **MQTT Unicode Support** - Fixed MQTT SMS sending to properly handle Unicode messages
- MQTT method now respects `"unicode": true` parameter in JSON payload (was previously ignored)
- Unicode messages sent via MQTT now display correctly instead of showing ????

### Technical Details
- Updated `mqtt_publisher.py` to extract and use unicode parameter from MQTT JSON payload
- Modified `_send_sms_via_gammu()` method to accept unicode_mode parameter
- Fixed hard-coded `"Unicode": False` that prevented Unicode encoding in MQTT messages
- MQTT Unicode handling now matches REST API and Native HA Service behavior

## [1.2.9] - 2025-01-19

### Fixed
- **Signal Strength Sensor** - Removed invalid `device_class: "signal_strength"` to make sensor appear in Home Assistant
- **MQTT Discovery** - Signal strength sensor now properly discovered and displayed in HA

### Technical Details
- Signal strength sensor uses percentage (%) instead of dBm, so device_class was incompatible
- Removed device_class allows HA to treat it as generic sensor with % unit

## [1.2.8] - 2025-01-19

### Changed
- Renamed add-on directory from `GamuGatewaySMS` to `sms-gammu-gateway` for consistency

## [1.2.6] - 2025-01-19

### Changed
- **Smart Field Clearing** - Only message text clears after sending, phone number persists for convenience
- Phone number stays for sending multiple messages to same recipient

## [1.2.5] - 2025-01-19

### Fixed
- **REST API Notify Compatibility** - API now accepts both standard and Home Assistant notify parameters
- Supports `text`/`message` and `number`/`target` interchangeably for better compatibility

## [1.2.4] - 2025-01-19

### Fixed
- **UI/Backend Sync** - Text fields now properly synchronize between Home Assistant UI and backend state
- Enhanced MQTT synchronization with bidirectional state handling

## [1.2.3] - 2025-01-19

### Fixed
- **Text Field Clearing** - Both phone number and message fields now clear reliably after sending

- **Breaking Change**: Both text fields now clear after SMS send (was keeping phone number)

## [1.1.9] - 2025-01-19

### Fixed
- **Empty Fields on Startup** - Text fields now start empty instead of showing "unknown"
- **Smart Field Clearing** - Only message text clears after send, phone number stays
